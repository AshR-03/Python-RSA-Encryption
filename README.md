## RSA Encryption from scratch using Python.
In this project, I use a range of mathematical techniques to code the hashing function SHA-256 and RSA encryption.

### What did I achieve with this project.

- Mathematical concepts such as Fermat's little theorem and Carmichaelâ€™s totient function to create public and private keys.
- Bitwise operators and handling buffers and working with binary values.
- ASCII conversions
